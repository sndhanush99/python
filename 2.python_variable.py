#Variables
#Variables are containers for storing data values.

#Creating Variables
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

#Example
x = 5   # x is of type int
y = "John"  # y is now of type str
print(x)
print(y)

#output 
#5
#John
