#Casting
#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
#Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#Get the Type
#You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
#Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

#String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
#Example
x = "John"
print(x)
# is the same as
x = 'John'
print(x)

#Case-Sensitive
#Variable names are case-sensitive.
#Example
#This will create two variables:
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
