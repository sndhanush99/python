1.Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

2.It is used for:
 web development (server-side),
 software development,
 mathematics,
 system scripting.

3.What can Python do?
 Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
 Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
 Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
 Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
 Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

4.Python Indentation
 Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

 Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

 Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
 Example 
 if 5 > 2:
   print("Five is greater than two!")

 Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
 Example
 Syntax Error:
 if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")

5.Python Comments
 Comments can be used to explain Python code.
 Example
  #This is a comment
  print("Hello, World!")

 Multiline Comments
 Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
 To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
 Example
  #This is a comment
  #written in
  #more than just one line
  print("Hello, World!")
